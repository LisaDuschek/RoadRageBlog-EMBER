  "text": "While wandering cross-country with everything I own in my CRV, I stopped to camp on the eastern edge of Wyoming. The evening was beautiful and filled with couscous out of the JetBoil. I was at the edge of a large plain. Cut to 3am, the wind was so strong it was ripping my tent out of the ground. Looking outside, I saw the storm coming across. The terrifying sight caused me to pull out my tent poles, roll the entire thing up (sleeping bag included) and shove it into what little space was left in my car. A woman came running from another section of the campground saying 'The red is coming!'. Apparently that means the center of the storm, which took me all night half-sleeping in my car to figure out. Good times had by all.",
